# AIMA
Implementation of some of the algorithms in Artificial Intelligence: A modern approach
This repository consists of the following algorithms that were implemented as a part of my Artificial Intelligence course. 
Most of the algorithms are based on the pseudocode present in AIMA. All of these algorithms were implemented in python 2.7

pruning.py: Contains implementations of minmax pruning and alpha-beta pruning for a modified version of the isolation game called Queen's 
isolation.
gaussian_mixture_models: Kmeans-clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models were implemented here.
search_algos.py: Uniform cost search,A*,Bidirectional search on the Romania map of AIMA.
hmm_viterbi.py: Contains an implementation of hidden markov models using the viterbi algorithm.
decision_trees.py: Decision trees and random forests using Gini Index to calculate the best split point.
